# Deletion Control
# - threshold   Age (in days) at which a file can be deleted
# - warnings    List of warning times (in hours before the deletion age)
#               at which a file's owner and group owner should be
#               notified

# NOTE These timings are relative to the fidelity in which the batch
# process is run. For example, if it's only run once per week and a
# warning time of one hour is specified, it's very likely that this
# warning will never be triggered.

deletion:
  threshold: 90
  warnings:
  - 700  # 10 days' notice
  - 72   # 3 days' notice
  - 24   # 24 hours' notice

# limited to this purpose.
